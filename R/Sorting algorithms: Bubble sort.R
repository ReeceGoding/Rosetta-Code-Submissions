#Context: Below. This replaced the previous solution.

#The previously solution missed out on a cool R trick for swapping items and had no check for lists of length 1.
#As R is 1-indexed, we have aimed to be as faithful as we can to the given pseudo-code.
bubbleSort<-function(items)
{
  repeat
  {
    if((itemCount<-length(items))<=1) return(items)
    hasChanged<-FALSE
    itemCount<-itemCount-1
    for(i in 1:itemCount)
    {
      if(items[i]>items[i+1])
      {
        items[c(i,i+1)]<-items[c(i+1,i)]#The cool trick mentioned above.
        hasChanged<-TRUE  
      }
    }
    if(!hasChanged) break
