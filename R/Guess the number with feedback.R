#Context: This solution replaced the site's previous solution.

#The previous solution lacked the required checks for if the input was appropriate,
#was bugged if low==high (R's sample function works differently if the input is of length 1),
#and behaved very strangely if low or high weren't whole numbers.

#This solution works on the assumption that the number to be found must be an integer
#and also assumes that the upper and lower bounds are distinct integers.
#It also assumes that the bounds are inclusive, e.g. that low=4 and high=5 is solvable.
#See Talk page for June 2020.

#R's system for checking if numbers are integers is lacking (e.g. is.integer(1) returns FALSE)
#so we need this next function.
#A better way to check for integer inputs can be found in is.interger's docs, but this is easier to read.
#Note that readline outputs the user's input as a string, hence the need for type.convert.
